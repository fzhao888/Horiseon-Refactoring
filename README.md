# Horiseon Refactoring

## Description

The Horiseon website was refactored to improve readability, accessibility, and sustainability.  In addition, all links were fixed so that they function correctly.

I built this project to understand HTML and CSS semantic structures and how to use Chrome DevTools to inspect the HTML and CSS of each element.
